        <p class="defn">
            Kanban is a framework that was first developed in the 1940s in Japan by Taiichi Ohno. The sole purpose of
            this system was to ensure ‘Just-in-time’ manufacturing practices, which allowed to minimize both the wait
            times and the amount of ready inventory to be stored by the company.
